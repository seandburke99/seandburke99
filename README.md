### Sean Burke
Electrical and Computer Engineering at Dalhousie University.
I really like challenging myself with projects that I am interested in. My interested areas are mainly:
1. Deep Learning
    I started with Tensorflow but I prefer Pytorch now. I usually utilize the python version for testing and design but for some projects I will use the cpp version.
3. C game/minigame development
    I am currently trying to learn how to use opengl for this.
5. Embedded C/C++
    Currently building a 3D printer of my own design.
I wouldn't call myself an expert but I like to solve problems by design of both hardware and software in many areas. I am constantly trying to learn and improve skills in the areas I am excited about.
